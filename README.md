# Greenlane AI Training

This repository contains a structured learning path for AI and developer tooling, organized into three skill levels:

- **Beginner** – Fundamentals of AI, prompt engineering basics, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and core concepts like LangChain, RAG, and AI ethics.
- **Intermediate** – Deeper prompt engineering patterns, RAG and LangChain/LangGraph concepts, MCP, custom GPTs, and designing conversational experiences.
- **Proficient** – Advanced topics focused on ambient agents with LangGraph and building context-aware agentic systems.

Each directory (`beginner`, `intermediate`, `proficient`) has a `README.md` listing learning materials. Every item includes:

- Name of the resource
- Source (provider/platform)
- Short description
- How/where to access the resource

Use these in order (Beginner → Intermediate → Proficient) as a guided curriculum for upskilling in AI-assisted development and modern AI application patterns.
