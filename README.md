# Greenlane AI Training

This repository contains a structured learning path for AI and developer tooling, organized into multiple skill levels:

- **Beginner** – Fundamentals of AI, prompt engineering basics, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and core concepts like LangChain, RAG, and AI ethics.
- **Intermediate** – Deeper prompt engineering patterns, RAG and LangChain/LangGraph concepts, MCP, custom GPTs, and designing conversational experiences.
- **Proficient** – Advanced topics focused on ambient agents with LangGraph and building context-aware agentic systems.
- **Advanced** – Additional advanced materials that deepen and extend concepts from the Proficient track.
- **Expert** – Expert-level resources for pushing beyond standard usage patterns and exploring cutting-edge AI workflows.

Each directory (`beginner`, `intermediate`, `proficient`, `advanced`, `expert`) has a `README.md` listing learning materials. Every item includes:

- Name of the resource
- Source (provider/platform)
- Short description
- How/where to access the resource

You can follow these in order (Beginner → Intermediate → Proficient → Advanced → Expert) as a guided curriculum for upskilling in AI-assisted development and modern AI application patterns, or dip into specific levels/resources as needed.
